## Future Ideas

Here are some future feature ideas that can further enhance the functionality and user experience of When2Run:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication and allow users to create accounts to save their preferences, running history, and personalized recommendations.

~~ . **Geolocation**: Instead of manually entering the zip code, integrate geolocation to automatically detect the user's location and provide weather data based on their current location. ~~

3. **Weather Forecast**: Extend the application to provide not only the current weather conditions but also a forecast for the upcoming hours or days. This can help users plan their runs in advance based on expected weather changes.

4. **Personalized Recommendations**: Enhance the running recommendations by taking into account user preferences, such as preferred temperature range, humidity levels, or weather conditions. Provide personalized suggestions tailored to each user's preferences.

5. **Run Tracking**: Implement a feature that allows users to track their running sessions, including distance, duration, and pace. Provide insights and statistics on their running performance over time.

6. **Social Sharing**: Enable users to share their running accomplishments, weather conditions, and recommended running routes on social media platforms. Encourage community engagement and support for fellow runners.

7. **Weather Alerts**: Set up weather alert notifications to inform users of extreme weather conditions, such as heatwaves, storms, or heavy rain. Ensure user safety by providing timely warnings and advisories.

8. **Integration with Fitness Trackers**: Integrate with popular fitness trackers or smartwatches to automatically sync running data, such as distance, calories burned, and heart rate, into the application. This can provide a comprehensive overview of users' running activities.

9. **Running Route Suggestions**: Offer suggestions for popular or scenic running routes based on the user's location. Incorporate maps and route details to help users discover new running paths and explore different areas.

10. **Weather Insights**: Provide educational content or articles related to running in different weather conditions. Offer tips, advice, and best practices for running in hot weather, cold weather, rain, or other specific weather conditions.

Feel free to explore these ideas and prioritize them based on your target audience and their needs. The goal is to continually improve the When2Run application and provide a valuable tool for runners to enhance their running experiences.
